          To be prepared to play in our Tournaments and Events We have build an
          advanced scrim system for our Rocket League community. Our seeders do
          their best job to look at your teams' past Tournaments performance and
          give you a rank. In that rank you can request and accept scrims to
          play a Best Off Series against similar ranked teams.
